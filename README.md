# SongChartTrends

Introduction: Disintermediation is the reduction in the use of intermediaries between producers and consumers, essentially cutting out the middlemen.

Research Question (Goal/Purpose): Does Disintermediation in the Music Industry allow Relatively Less Talented/Original Artists to become more successful in the Billboards?

Gap: Comparing current and previous chart data to prove disintermediation through the quality of songs.

Data: Spotify Chart Data obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year). The dataset was split into two parts based on the timeframe. DataSet 1 had 2010-2014 Spotify Charts, and DataSet 2 had 2018-2019 Spotify Charts

Findings:
Surprisingly, there was no change in the duration of top songs. Recent songs had more variation in tempo
(from 130 BPM (Beats Per Minute) to either 80-100 BPM or 120-140 BPM). The moods of recent popular songs have overall become more negative (in terms of lyricism and musical scales), hence the rise of more low energy songs. The number of clusters in energy levels of a song (histogram) increased from 2 to 5.

Conclusion: While disintermediation makes quantity a top priority over quality, present day's song chart data shows that artists are more original because creating and publishing music has become more accessible.

Further Research: Use different datasets such as Billboard Charts that include categories such as Genre, CD, vinyl sales, and streams (Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Youtube/Google Play Music), and Billboard datasets before 1999 (Launch of Napster)
